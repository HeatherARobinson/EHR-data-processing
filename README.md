# EHR-data-processing

The codes within this repository have been used to create wide format patient data tables based on raw data from EHR systems, and may require adaption for application to new EHR formats. 

Logic pipelines used to process text based prescribing data have been adapted from the PERL based programme 'Research Events Medication' with kind permission from Richard Williams (https://github.com/rw251).
